# Apollo React Components

This is a monorepo for the development of reusable react components based on EDS.

## What's inside?

This turborepo uses [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) as a package manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `ui`: a stub React component library
- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) for git hooks
